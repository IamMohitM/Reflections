1. What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you needd it?
A- A new repository is created(.git). We need to track changes to our files. It record history of our file.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?
A- Files in the staging area are like the part of the project where the changes have been made and where the changes need
to be committed. It's more like starting to track your files.
It gives more control in our VCS. We can commit multiple files in our staging are in just one go.
