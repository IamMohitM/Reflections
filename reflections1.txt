How could history of a file help to make you an effiecient programmer?

It's easier to debug

Why do you think some version-control systems like Git allow multiple files in one commit, while others.
like Google Docs treat each file seperately?

Initially, Git was created for programming. In Programming each file can be related to multiple files and hence,
change in one can effect other files. While Google docs is ot used for programming but for writing reports, posts etc.
And changes in one file can't/won't effect or are related to other files.

How can use git log and git diff to view history of files?

Git log displays all the commits. Commit is a snapshot of all files in your repository.
Git diff shows the differences between two commits.
