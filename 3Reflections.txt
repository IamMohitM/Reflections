When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When we have a team project we might want to collaborate using a remote repository. That way the team won't be dependent on one member and
will also have multiple copies of project if each clone the repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if we are adding a new feature if each commit is pulled it might create confusion as complete feature might not be available.
Usualy a new feature has more than one commit.
