1. How does having access an entire history of a file make you a  more efficient programmer in the long run?
A- It helps us to quickly realise changes we've made in the past.
 If not available we could lose the stable version of our program.

2. Why do you think some version controls like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
each file seperately?
A- Multiple files can be dependant or related to each other for their functions. So change in one file can effect the behaviour of 
other files. Hence, they allow commit for multiple files.

3. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A- Git log shows the all the commits, which are the logical seperations of out project over time. git diff can be used to 
differentiate any two version in the history of the project.
